- To design a one-way reinforced concrete slab for a given set of loading and design parameters.
- To design a two-way reinforced concrete slab to support a given load under specified
conditions.
### Objective
- To understand the principles of structural design related to one-way slabs.
- To determine the design loads including dead load, live load, and other applicable loads.
- To calculate the bending moments, shear forces, and deflections in the one-way slab.
- To select appropriate reinforcement for the slab based on design criteria.
- To sketch the reinforcement layout and detail the reinforcement specifications.
- To understand the principles and concepts involved in the design of two-way reinforced concrete slabs.
